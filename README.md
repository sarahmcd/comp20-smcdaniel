### What is COMP 20?
Ming Chow's Web Programming class is a course of interesting [and necessarily plural] balances. In COMP 20, students are simultaneously exposed to a wide range of web-related coding and development [basic aspects of web design, web application development, game development, and web security -- to name a few] and to tools and programming practices essential to web programming and software development in general [JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js and express, revision control, GitHub and Heroku, nifty and new text editors -- the list goes on].

More than anything, however, COMP 20 is a class that fittingly reflects the constantly changing nature of the World Wide Web: It is a course in which students must actively seek out information to develop their own answers to their own questions. One's work in COMP 20 is ultimately self-defined; one must ask, answer, and [indeed, most importantly] Google for oneself.

### My favorite project
Even though this has been [and will continue to be] the most stressful project of the semester, the group project is my favorite project from COMP 20. I am exhausted to think of the amount of work that remains to be done as Cameron, Tara, Jessie, and I work to finish our implementation of FlightStalk -- but I am also exhilarated by the prospect of completing a project that is distinctly ours.

The semester project really does offer the opportunity to take ownership of one's work -- and to let one's work take one somewhere.

### Project of which I am most proud
Curiously enough, I am most proud of my HTML5 Frogger game. This was the project I most dreaded [thinking myself hopeless in the realm of game development], but ultimately my game reflected the hours of research and trial and error I put into it.

### Growth, progress, improvements
- My ability [and, more importantly, my willingness and enthusiasm] to dive into and seek out/attempt/learn new material and tools has increased fiftyfold.
- I know how to ask questions -- of TAs, of peers, of StackOverflow.
- I have begun programming with git in other classes and for other projects. Revision control has very legitimately altered the way I code.
- I have gained a formidable amount of experience with completely aspects of the web [interfaces, tools, languages, et al.] that were utterly novel to me at the onset of the semester.
- I have mastered the art of Google and embraced the veracity of Ming's constant aphorism: "RTFM."

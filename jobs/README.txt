COMP 20 [Lab 7]: Ming Chow job directory
jobs.html is a directory for various technology- and software-related jobs and internships. I modified the script in jobs.html to parse a JSON string and display each position, its locations, and its company.

I spent approximately forty-five minutes on this assignment and collaborated with Jessie Serrino.

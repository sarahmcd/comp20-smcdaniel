COMP 20 [Assignment 4]: Frogger, Part II

The files index.html, style.css, and game.js [along with corresponding asset .png image files] implement an HTML5 Frogger game playable in web browsers. The code written for this assignment uses and is based upon code written for a previous assignment in which I rendered a Frogger gameboard using the HTML5 canvas.

IMPLEMENTED IN THIS ASSIGNMENT:
- Game loads on page load
- Player can move frog piece using UP, DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT arrow keys
- Additional vehicles and logs rendered
- All vehicles and logs animated
- Collision detection implemented [such that Frogger loses one life one struck by a vehicle]
- Basic game scoring [10 points for moving forward] implemented

COLLABORATION AND REFERENCE:
I discussed methods for implementing animation and collision detection with Cameron Jackson and Jessie Serrino.
My HTML5 version of Frogger is based on that playable at www.playfrogger.org.

I spent approximately five hours completing the assignment for which I rendered the Frogger gameboard. I spent approximately ten hours completing the playable version of the game.

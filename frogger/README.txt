COMP 20 [Assignment 2]: Frogger
The files index.html, style.css, and game.js [along with corresponding asset .png image files] render a board for a frogger web browser game. All images render correctly, index.html passes the official HTML5 specifications, and style.css passes the official CSS validation. JavaScript functions have been correctly implemented and in such a manner as to be reusable in future frogger coding projects.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment; I clarified grading expectations for the assignment with Cameron Jackson and Jessie Serrino, which later helped me design my .js file.
I spent approximately five hours completing this assignment.
